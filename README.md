## Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is RogÃ©rio Ribeiro MacÃªdo. I'm an undergraduate student in Chemistry Education at the Federal University of ItajubÃ¡ (@unifei_oficial). I'm an undergraduate researcher in a Computational Chemistry project at LaQC (Laboratory of Computational Chemistry, @laqc_unifei), where I develop Python scripts and conduct molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS.

## Interest

I have a great interest in Neuroscience, but at this moment, I am only reading about this subject.

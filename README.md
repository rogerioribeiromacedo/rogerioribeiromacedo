## :wave: Hi

My name is Rogério Ribeiro Macêdo. I'm an undergraduate student in Chemistry Education at the Federal University of Itajubá ([@unifei_oficial](https://www.instagram.com/unifei_oficial/)). I'm an undergraduate researcher in a Computational Chemistry project at LaQC (Laboratory of Computational Chemistry, [@laqc_unifei](https://www.instagram.com/laqc_unifei/)), where I develop Python scripts and conduct molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS.

## :scientist: Interest

* **Neuroscience**, but at this moment, I am only reading about this subject.
* Python
* Molecular Modeling & Animations Blender
* Molecular dynamics simulations

## :sparkle: Project

I started a project called "Química na Caixinha" ([@quimicanacaixinha](https://www.instagram.com/quimicanacaixinha/)) on Instagram. The idea is to add molecular models created with Blender and technical information about the structure. It is still in the development phase.
